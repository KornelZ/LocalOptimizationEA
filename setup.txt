1. If you have dir LocalOptimizationEA/coco/code-experiments/build/python:
    1.1. File LocalOptimizationEA/coco/code-experiments/build/python/example_experiment.py
         is the execution script, we will have to replace the solver function.
    1.2. Read how to call example_experiment.py (info is in the script), how to specify budget and solver etc.
    1.3. File LocalOptimizationEA/coco/code-experiments/build/python/python/solvers.py contains sample
                random search solver. We will replace it with our EA.
2. If you dont have it or it does not work:
    2.1. Go to LocalOptimizationEA/coco
    2.2. Run sudo apt-get install build-essential python-dev python-numpy python-matplotlib \
                python-scipy python-six python-setuptools
    2.3. Run sudo python do.py run-python
    2.4. Run sudo python do.py install-postprocessing
3. To check if everything works:
    3.1. Go to LocalOptimizationEA/coco/code-experiments/build/python
    3.2. Run sudo python example_experiment_for_beginners.py
